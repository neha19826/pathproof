# PathProof  
## Graph-Based Financial Crime Detection Engine

PathProof is a web-based financial forensics application that detects **money muling networks** using graph theory and transaction analysis.

Traditional database queries fail to detect multi-hop laundering patterns. PathProof converts transaction data into a directed graph and identifies suspicious accounts, fraud rings, and high-risk transaction flows through structural network analysis.
